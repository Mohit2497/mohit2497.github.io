Iâ€™m currently following **Zac Wilsonâ€™s Beginner Data Engineering Bootcamp** on [DataExpert.io](https://dataexpert.io), and this week I completed **Module 2.1**, which focuses on building a simple **REST API extractor** using Python.  

The goal of this mini-project was to build a script that connects to the [Polygon.io](https://polygon.io) API, pulls stock ticker data, and saves it into a clean CSV file. Itâ€™s a small but important milestone: reading data from an external API, handling multiple pages of results, and producing a structured dataset thatâ€™s ready for analysis.

## ðŸ“Œ What the Script Does

This project contains a single Python script, `script.py`, which:

- Connects to the Polygon.io API and requests a list of stock tickers  
- Follows the `"next"` link in the API response until all pages are fetched  
- Normalizes and writes the data into a CSV file (`tickers.csv`)  
- Ensures consistent columns for every row  
- Stops and shows an error message if the API returns any errors
